The scale and diversity of our problems call for sharing, reusing and leveraging our existing assets and resources. If we all share and learn, we can all rapidly create many more contextual solutions.</p><br><p class=\"pb-15 text\">SPace (Societal Platform Assets Collaboration Environment) is your platform to share your assets and resources. SPace is your platform to leverage assets and resources shared by other Societal Platform Missions. SPace connects people and organisations who share technology, protocols, processes, methods and data as a public good.</p><br><p class=\"pb-15 text\">SPace is an outcome of your collective efforts, and that of all your fellow practitioners of the Societal Platform approach. Learn more about Societal Platform Thinking.</p><br><p class=\"pb-15 text\">You are welcome to leverage, co-create and contribute.
